1. Same Tile Constraint

In this feature, we’ve added logic to prevent two players from occupying the same tile simultaneously. Here’s how it works:
	•	If a player’s movement lands them on a tile already occupied by another player, they will either move to the nearest unoccupied tile or lose their turn.
	•	This feature adds an element of strategy, encouraging players to think carefully about their moves and anticipate their opponent’s path.
	•	Why it matters: It prevents players from blocking each other unfairly while keeping the gameplay competitive and engaging.

2. Extra Boost on Positive Random Events (5 Points)

We’ve enhanced positive random events to include a 5-point bonus to Pride Points in addition to their existing benefits.
	•	For instance, if a random event rewards stamina or wisdom points, players will also receive an extra boost in their Pride Points.
	•	Why it matters: This tweak makes positive events more impactful, rewarding players for their progress and motivating them to embrace the risk of encountering random events.
3. Unique Special Tiles for Each Path Type (5 Points)

To differentiate the two paths players can choose—Cub Training or Pride Lands—we’ve implemented unique special tiles for each.
	•	For example:
	•	Cub Training Path has tiles like “Oasis” that grant stamina and extra turns, and “Counseling” that boosts all stats and allows players to change advisors.
	•	Pride Lands Path has tiles like “Graveyard,” which deducts points, or “Challenge,” which tests the player’s wisdom with riddles.
	•	Why it matters: This makes each path distinct, allowing players to strategize based on their strengths and preferences. It adds depth and replayability to the game.

Presentation for Extra Credit - you can create this for your Professor 

I understand we also need a presentation for extra credit. Here’s what I propose:
	•	Introduction (30 seconds): A brief overview of the game concept and its goals.
	•	Feature Highlights (2 minutes): Explain key mechanics like the Same Tile Constraint, Random Event Boost, and Special Tiles for each path. I can provide examples during this section.
	•	Demo (1 minute): A quick gameplay demonstration showcasing how players navigate the board, encounter events, and make strategic choices.
	•	Conclusion (30 seconds): Recap how these features enhance the game and why they make it fun and educational.
